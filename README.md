Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Last Bullet, and man, what a ride. Seriously, the adrenaline was real, but also, I think I lost half my brain cells trying to follow that plot. No joke, I mean, they just throw you into the action, like boom, here’s chaos, deal with it. 😂

Honestly, I was what the actual for most of it. The main guy, what was his name again? Bill or Ben? Whatever, that dude is like a mix of James Bond and John Wick, but with less suave and more why is he like this? vibes. Anyone else notice how everyone just magically knows where to find him, no matter where he hides? GPS magic.

> So there’s this part, right? Where everyone’s shooting at each other and all I can think is, must be a freaking nightmare for the sound department. Bang, crash, something explodes, and I'm just sittin’ there, popcorn in hand, wondering if it’s too late to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   again and catch all the stuff I missed. Like honestly, sometimes I can't tell if they’re trying to kill each other or if it’s some weird team-building exercise.

And the ending, don’t even get me started. It’s like, the moment everything should make sense, they just drop another plot twist bomb on you. Classic. I should’ve known better. Didn’t help that I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   at like, 1 am, so my tired brain was probably not placing bets on figuring stuff out. 

By the way, remind me never to trust a character with shifty eyes and a mysterious accent. That’s like, the international sign for “Hey, I’m the baddie.” Seriously, every time! Anyway, gotta love  s that keep you guessing, but maybe not when you need sleep. 😆

I mean, what can I even say? It was a wild ride. That one chase scene, though, like, major Indiana Jones vibes, but if Indy was running from his existential crisis instead of giant boulders. It's almost poetic, really. Okay, maybe that’s pushing it. But yeah, I'm off to Google what the hell just happened and see if there's a fan theory I can latch onto. Later!
